# Decentralized To-Do List

## Project Description
The Decentralized To-Do List is a blockchain-powered task manager where users can create, toggle, view, and delete their personal tasks without any centralized server. Each user's data is securely stored on-chain and is only accessible to them.

## Project Vision
To provide a censorship-resistant and persistent task management tool that leverages the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology. Users retain full control and ownership over their task data.

## Key Features
- **Add Task**: Users can add new tasks that are recorded on-chain.
- **Toggle Task Completion**: Tasks can be marked as completed or incomplete.
- **View My Tasks**: Each user can view only their own list of tasks.
- **Delete Task**: Users can remove tasks from their list.
- **Personalized Storage**: All tasks are mapped per user address.

## Future Scope
- Enable tagging and prioritization of tasks.
- Add due dates and reminders via event logs.
- Integrate frontend DApp with wallet connection.
- Support cross-device syncing using decentralized storage.
- Add batch operations (mark all as done, delete all, etc).
